## Description
 > This is a CLI designed to help developers produce a professionally structured README markdown file for use on project repositories.

## Installation
 > This project requires Node.JS and NPM to be installed. Please reference Node documentation for detailed instructions on how to install those. To install my program: 1. Clone the repository. 2. Open a terminal and cd to where you cloned the repository. 3.Run `npm i` in your terminal to install Node package dependencies. 4. Run `node index.js` in your terminal.

## Usage
 > Answer the prompts that are displayed in your terminal. Once all the prompts are answered, the program will log what you typed, a message indicating the file is saved, and write README.md to the root directory of the cloned repository (i.e. /readme-generator-cli/README.md).

## Issues
 > The answers you give to the questions from this program should accept most markdown formatting arguments, except those that perform newline/multiline functionality. Since the CLI uses inquirer.js as its base, it may be possible to work around this by using an editor input type, but the current version of this program does not do this. Another planned feature is to accept contributors' GitHub profiles to generate a dynamic list of contributors in the Credits section.

## Contribution
 > Feel free to submit issues and pull requests on the GitHub repository as you come across them. I'm more than happy to work with anyone who wants to contribute to improving the project!

## Credits
 > This project could not have been possible without the developers of the Inquirer.js Node module, which provides the base of this program. I also wish to extend my thanks to the central graders at Georgia Tech, and the instructors and TAs at the Trilogy/Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp.
